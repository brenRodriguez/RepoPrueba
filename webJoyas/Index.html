			<p>Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her. I hope so. Why is she gonna get angry with you? What did your mother ever see in that kid? Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh.</p>
			<p>What? Are those my clocks I hear? I'm gonna be at the dance. Save the clock tower. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl.</p>
			<p style="background-color: #FFFFFF">What was it, George, bird watching? Get your meat hooks off of me. Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. Where does he come from? That ain't no airplane, look.</p>
